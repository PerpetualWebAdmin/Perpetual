                <p>Civil Engineering is one of the most diverse branches of engineering in terms of range of problems that fall within its preview and in the range of knowledge required to solve those problems.  
                    Civil Engineer plans, designs, construct and maintain a large variety of structures and facilities for public, commercial and industrial use. These structures include residential, office and factory building; highways, railroads, airports, tunnels, bridges, harbors, channels and pipelines. 
                    It also deals with other many facilities that are a part of the transportation systems of most countries, as well as sewage and waste disposal systems that add convenience and safeguard of our health.</p><br>
