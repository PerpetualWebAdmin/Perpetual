                In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development
                Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 interconnected objectives aimed at
                promoting economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental
                protection. These goals serve as a universal call to action to
                end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity
                for all. Therefore, the SDGs serve as the blueprint to achieve a
                better and more sustainable future for all. The 17 SDGs are as
                follows: SDG1 No Poverty; SDG2 Zero Hunger; SDG3 Good Health and
                Well-being; SDG4 Quality Education; SDG5 Gender Equality; SDG6
                Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG7 Affordable and Clean Energy;
                SDG8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG9 Industry, Innovation,
                and Infrastructure; SDG10 Reduced Inequalities; SDG11
                Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG12 Responsible
                Consumption and Production; SDG 13 Climate Action; SDG14 Life
                Below Water; SDG15 Life on Land, SDG16 Peace, Justice, and
                Strong Institutions and SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals.

                Years following the adoption of SDGs, organizations around the
                globe have exerted their best efforts to contribute in achieving
                the goals. The University of Perpetual Help System Laguna as an
                institution of higher learning, stays committed to making an
                impact not only in the local community but also in our global
                village. For its part, different research outputs have been
                produced, each of which is aligned with a specific SDG. For the
                Academic Year 2022-2023, forty-four(44) research articles have
                been published to reputable journals, hitting 4 SDGs (i.e., good
                health and well-being, quality education, decent work and
                economic growth, and industry, innovation and infrastructure).
                This feat does not only improve the research portfolio of the
                institution but also advance the knowledge frontiers in various
                disciplines. We have allotted the last few pages of this Annual

                While UPHSL continually takes the path of realizing all SDGs, it
                has to address the challenges associated challenges while taking
                advantage of opportunities available. Key challenges include
                multi-sectoral coordination, significant investment and resource
                allocation and mobilization, data collection and monitoring,
                tailoring SDGs to national and local contexts and raising
                awareness and participation of institutional stakeholders.
                Responding to these concerns will propel UPHSL into a higher
                status of academic recognition with better national and
                international reputation

                On a final note, the University of Perpetual Help System Laguna
                strongly recognizes the Sustainable Development Goals as a
                powerful movement with a transformative vision for a more
                equitable, sustainable, and peaceful world. While challenges
                exist, the SDGs present opportunities for innovation,
                collaboration, and collective action. As the Philippines
                continues to work towards achieving these goals, our academic
                community will work tirelessly in order to ensure policy
                coherence, stakeholder engagement, and evidence-based
                decision-making so that all SDGs will be realized in our
                institutional operations.

                    been produced which were aligned with SDG 3: Good Health and

                    psychological well-being of local college instructors
                    yielded 3 citations whereas the paper on owning and loving
                    pet animals by Del Rosario et al received 2 citations.
                    Finally, the study which looked into how instructional

                    While we recognize that our accomplishment of SDGs is still
                    humbling, we take this stride as a reminder that a “journey
                    of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” This
                    founding step we took will pave the way for a continuous
                    assessment of our outputs with SDGs in our collective
                    consciousness as an academic community which has a power to
                    make a difference. Despite the problems we face in the
                    Philippines, our university remains resilient and chooses to
                    dance with the rain, not to cry in the storm
                  </p>

                  <p class="second-final">
                    For the years ahead, we will intensify our publication and
                    citation efforts, ensuring that we have outputs per SDG
                    while specifically maximizing goals which are congruent with
                    our vision and mission as an institution of higher learning.
                    Through concerted and sterling efforts of our stakeholders
                    (i.e., school administrators, faculty, students, alumni,
                    parents, industry partners, NGOs, government and private
                    entities), we are confident that we can create an impact for
                    the planet today and beyond.
